# crawler-media

A self-hosted media automation system that also serves the library. The user names a movie or TV season; the system keeps searching configured PT sites, downloading matching torrents, and organizing files into a **Library** that playback clients can open as a Jellyfin server.

## Language

**Media**:
A canonical movie or TV work assembled from one or more **Metadata sources**. Identity is an internal id; TMDB / Douban / TVDB / Bangumi / AniList ids are aliases. A TV **Media** is identified at work level; a season is a range on a **Subscribe**, not a separate **Media**.
_Avoid_: 剧, show, title (as the identified object), TMDB result

**Subscribe**:
A long-running target that binds one **Media** to a coverage range (a movie, or a TV season and episode window) plus search/download policy. It records download facts (which episodes exist, and at what quality) and keeps filling or upgrading that range until it completes.
_Avoid_: 搜索任务, watchlist, request, 追更

**Site**:
A configured PT tracker the system is allowed to search. Runtime credentials (cookie, API key, RSS URL, proxy, rate limit, optional CDP endpoint) live on the **Site**; HTML/API parsing rules live on the **Indexer**. Login and **Check-in** are not search; they keep this **Site** authenticated.
_Avoid_: tracker (except when quoting BT protocol), 爬虫配置

**Indexer**:
The parsing/search adapter for one **Site**: a framework (NexusPHP HTML or API) plus a per-site YAML overlay for selectors, categories, and RSS. Fetching a search/RSS page uses HTTP by default, or a **Browser** when the profile sets `render`. Built-in profiles ship with the app; a user overlay directory can replace a profile without a rebuild. An **Indexer** does not own login credentials. M-Team is a first-class API exception behind the same **Torrent** output; other API sites follow that pattern. Search across enabled **Sites** is concurrent; one **Site** failing does not fail the others.
_Avoid_: spider, crawler, scraper (as the configured object)

**Torrent**:
A normalized candidate from a **Site** search or RSS pull: title, size, seeders, enclosure/download URL, free/HR flags, and optional IMDB id. It is not yet a download task.
_Avoid_: 资源 (too vague), SearchResult (implementation name), magnet (one enclosure form)

**Downloader**:
An external BitTorrent client the system talks to (qBittorrent or Transmission). The system adds **Torrents** to it and later reads completed files; it does not download bytes itself.
_Avoid_: 下载模块 (the code package), client (too generic)

**Library**:
The authoritative on-disk collection the instance owns: which **Media** we have, at what quality, at which path. **Subscribe**, **Transfer**, **Scrape**, and **Playback** all read this, not the **Downloader** save path. A **Library** has a kind (movie or TV), one or more root paths, and a ledger of files. Ledger quality (resolution, codec, HDR) comes from probing the file at **Transfer** time; the **Release** parsed from a name is fallback only.
_Avoid_: 媒体库路径 (as the concept), collection (MoviePilot uses this for TMDB collections), Jellyfin library (that's a view over this)

**Transfer**:
Moving completed files from a **Downloader** (or an intake **Watch directory**) into the **Library**, including rename. The **Transfer mode** is user-configured: hardlink, copy, or move. Default is hardlink when source and destination share a filesystem, otherwise copy.
_Avoid_: 整理 (too broad; includes **Scrape**), 入库 (the outcome, not the action)

**Naming template**:
An instance-global relative-path pattern for **Transfer**, one for movie **Media** and one for TV **Media**. Placeholders expand from **Media**, **Release**, and the probed file. Empty values omit empty parentheses. Stored in SQLite; defaults live in `library::default_pattern`.
_Avoid_: Jinja, format string (too generic), 重命名规则 (synonym — use **Naming template**)

**Transfer mode**:
How bytes are placed in the **Library**: hardlink, copy, or move. Move removes the source; hardlink and copy do not. After a successful **Wash-cut**, the previous **Library** files are deleted regardless of mode (a leftover hardlink does not delete the **Downloader**'s seeding copy).
_Avoid_: 链接, 拷贝策略

**Wash-cut**:
A **Subscribe** mode that keeps replacing an already-owned movie or episode with a higher-quality **Torrent**. Ordinary fill and wash-cut share the same per-episode existence and quality facts; they differ in completion rules. TV wash-cut is per-episode by default; a full-season pack is an optional constraint on the same **Subscribe**, not a second product.
_Avoid_: 洗版订阅 (as a separate entity), re-subscribe, upgrade-only job

**Filter**:
A named group of atomic rules. Built-in atoms (resolution, source, free, HR, subtitle language, …) plus user-defined atoms (title match, size, seeders, site) are composed into a group. A group both *rejects* a **Torrent** and *scores* survivors: the score is the highest priority among matched atoms. Manual search and **Subscribe** bind a group; **Wash-cut** may bind a second group and otherwise reuses the same one.
_Avoid_: 优先级 (as the rule object), 质量 (as the rule object), 选种规则 (synonym — use **Filter**)

**Fetch mode**:
Per-**Subscribe** choice of how to obtain **Torrents**: keyword search, RSS, or both. Search and RSS are two fetch methods on the **Indexer**, not two subscription systems.
_Avoid_: 搜索模式 (ambiguous with media search), 爬取模式

**Metadata source**:
An external catalog used to identify and describe **Media**: TMDB, Douban, TVDB, Bangumi, AniList. Sources can alias the same **Media**; they are not themselves the **Media**.
_Avoid_: scraper (that's **Scrape**), recognizer

**Scrape**:
Writing sidecar metadata next to files — **NFO** plus artwork — so **Playback** and any external scanner can identify them. **Scrape** can run after **Transfer**, on a **Watch directory**, or on a path the user points at. It is optional and switchable; **Transfer** does not imply **Scrape**.
_Avoid_: INFO, 刮削模块 (as the concept), embed metadata into the video

**NFO**:
The XML sidecar file written beside a movie, season, or episode file. This is the Emby/Jellyfin convention.
_Avoid_: INFO, .txt metadata

**Watch directory**:
A filesystem path the system observes. It may be an intake path (new files get transferred into the **Library**) or a library path (existing files get **Scraped** in place). Those are different jobs and must not share one implicit meaning.
_Avoid_: 监控 (too vague), inotify

**Hook**:
A named extension point on a workflow step (choose **Torrent**, add to **Downloader**, transfer, rename, **Scrape**) where a **Plugin** may observe, veto, or adjust that step. A **Hook** does not replace the **Indexer** or **Downloader** module.
_Avoid_: middleware, interceptor, callback

**Plugin**:
An optional first-party (later also user-supplied) extension that registers **Hooks**. Login and **Check-in** ship as **Plugins** that drive a **Browser**. Core Indexer / Downloader / Media / Library search-and-file code is compiled-in modules, not **Plugins**. A third-party loader is still later; first-party **Plugins** compile against the same Hook + **Browser** APIs that loader will use.
_Avoid_: 插件市场 (a distribution surface, not the concept)

**User**:
A person who owns **Subscribes**, a login, and their own **Playback** progress. **Sites**, **Downloaders**, **Indexer** profiles, and the **Library** files are shared by the instance. A **User** is not a second media library.
_Avoid_: account, tenant

**Release**:
A parsed reading of a torrent title or a filename, as separate fields: title, year, season/episode range, resolution, source, codec, HDR, subtitle language, audio language, group. It is not **Media** and not a **Torrent**. Matching and **Transfer** naming both consume a **Release**. Low confidence does not guess: auto-**Subscribe** skips that **Torrent**; an intake **Watch directory** parks the file as **Unidentified**.
_Avoid_: MediaMeta (movietools type name), MetaInfo (MoviePilot type name)

**Unidentified**:
A file (or **Torrent**) whose **Release** or **Media** match is below confidence. It is listed for a **User** to claim; the system does not **Transfer** or download it on guesswork.
_Avoid_: 失败, unknown media

**Playback**:
Serving **Library** files to clients. External apps (Infuse, Fileball, and similar) talk to a Jellyfin-compatible HTTP API and treat this instance as a Jellyfin server. Playback routes, including video streams, follow Jellyfin protocol authentication and remain authenticated. Static artwork routes stay public for native image requests. **Playback** does not replace the **Downloader**.
_Avoid_: 媒体服务器 (too broad), 转码服务 (a later, separate capability)

**Browser**:
A CDP session used to fetch JS-rendered pages and to drive login / **Check-in**. Default is: no Chromium in the image. Enabling **Browser** downloads a managed Chromium (or connects to a **Site** `cdp_url` / a user-opened headed Chrome). Headless is the default once present. This is a fetch/automation channel, not a Windows remote desktop.
_Avoid_: RDP, 无头模块, Playwright (implementation)

**Check-in**:
A scheduled **Site** maintenance action (attendance / cookie refresh). Implemented as a **Plugin** on **Browser** or HTTP. It does not produce **Torrents** and is not a **Fetch mode**.
_Avoid_: 签到模块 (as core Indexer), attendance search

**Job**:
One unit of work the instance can queue, run, retry, or inspect: **Subscribe** search/RSS, **Transfer**, **Scrape**, **Check-in**, catalog refresh, later Watch-directory intake. Definitions (`job_defs`) carry schedule; each run is a `jobs` row in SQLite. **Hooks** intercept steps inside a **Job**; they are not the queue.
_Avoid_: scheduler (the loop, not the record), APScheduler, cron (the schedule string is not the concept), 任务系统 (synonym — use **Job**)

## Relationships

- A **Subscribe** is owned by one **User** and targets exactly one **Media**
- A **Subscribe** has a **Fetch mode** and a **Filter**
- A **Media** has one internal id and optional aliases from **Metadata sources**
- A **Site** is searched through its **Indexer** (HTTP or **Browser**, then the same selectors)
- Search and RSS both produce **Torrents**
- A **Filter** admits and scores a **Torrent** (via its **Release**) for a **Subscribe**
- A **Downloader** receives a **Torrent** and later yields files that are **Transferred** into the **Library**
- **Wash-cut** is a mode of a **Subscribe**, not a separate record
- **Scrape** writes **NFO** and artwork beside **Library** files
- **Playback** reads the **Library** ledger; it does not own files
- Login and **Check-in** are **Plugins** that may use **Browser**; they write back **Site** credentials
- A **Plugin** participates only through **Hooks**; first-party modules and first-party **Plugins** share that bus
- **Sites**, **Downloaders**, and the **Library** are instance-global, not per-**User**
- A **Job** is the runnable unit for search, **Transfer**, **Scrape**, and **Check-in**; a **Subscribe** is policy, not a thread
- Creating a **Subscribe** inserts its search **Job** definition; **Transfer** is instance-wide, not per-**Subscribe**
- **Transfer** names files with the **Naming template** for that **Media** kind; the **Downloader** filename is not kept
